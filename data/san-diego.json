Entities within a system are addressed individually by an open-ended URL-style symbolic naming scheme that includes a powerful pattern matching language to specify multiple recipients of a single message. We provide high resolution time tags and a mechanism for specifying groups of messages whose effects are to occur simultaneously. There is also a mechanism for dynamically querying an Open SoundControl system to find out its capabilities and documentation of its features.\"</p> <p><a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/open-soundcontrol-a-new-protocol-for-communicating-with.pdf?c=icmc;idno=bbp2372.1997.033;format=pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/open-soundcontrol-a-new-protocol-for-communicating-with.pdf?c=icmc;idno=bbp2372.1997.033;format=pdf</a></p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues north of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

Dürst (1997).</p> <p>Presented by Marvin Humphrey.</p> <p>OVERVIEW:</p> <p>Created by Ken Thompson one night in September 1992 on a placemat in a New Jersey diner, UTF-8 is a spectacular quintuple bank shot of design: optimal across so many criteria that it's hard to believe anybody could pull it off.</p> <p>Over the years, UTF-8 has increasingly eclipsed all of the alternatives. UTF-1 and UTF-7 are obsolete and only of historical interest; UTF-32 has limited practical utility; UCS-2 can't express all of Unicode... the only serious competitor remaining is UTF-16, but UTF-8 has continued to gain market share.</p> <p>In 1997, Martin J. Dürst gave a talk at the 11th International Unicode Conference in San Jose on \"The Properties and Promises of UTF-8\". Two decades later at Papers We Love San Diego, we will review those marvelous properties and contemplate all of the promises that UTF-8 has fulfilled.</p> <p>DOWNLOAD:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sw.it.aoyama.ac.jp/2012/pub/IUC11-UTF-8.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sw.it.aoyama.ac.jp/2012/pub/IUC11-UTF-8.pdf</a></p> <p>SLIDES:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rectangular.com/preso-utf8-props-promises.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rectangular.com/preso-utf8-props-promises.pdf</a></p> <p>AUXILIARY MATERIALS:</p> <p>Here is a Rob Pike email from 2003 describing the scene in the diner, along with historical emails from Ken Thompson in 1992 articulating some of the design criteria for UTF-8:</p> <p><a href=\"http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utf-8_history\" class=\"linkified\">http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utf-8_history</a></p> <p>SOME ADVICE ON READING THE PAPER:</p> <p>Dürst's \"paper\" is really the transcription of a talk. Each page consists of a slide at the top, accompanied by text transcribing the presenter's narration over that slide. As a result, while the paper is 26 pages, it is not dense.</p> <p>A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to heuristic detection of UTF-8. We will simply accept that heuristic detection of UTF-8 works very well — so feel free to gloss over the details of the heuristic algorithm.</p> <p>If you don't have time to read the paper, contemplate the six design criteria enumerated by Ken Thompson in his 1992 email:</p> <p>1) Compatibility with historical file systems: Historical file systems disallow the null byte and the ASCII slash character as a part of the file name.</p> <p>2) Compatibility with existing programs: The existing model for multibyte processing is that ASCII does not occur anywhere in a multibyte encoding. There should be no ASCII code values for any part of a transformation format representation of a character that was not in the ASCII character set in the UCS representation of the character.</p> <p>3) Ease of conversion from/to UCS.</p> <p>4) The first byte should indicate the number of bytes to follow in a multibyte sequence.</p> <p>5) The transformation format should not be extravagant in terms of number of bytes used for encoding.</p> <p>6) It should be possible to find the start of a character efficiently starting from an arbitrary location in a byte stream.</p> <p>In addition consider the following three properties of UTF-8:</p> <p>A) Although UTF-8 is inefficient for CJK (Chinese Japanese Korean) texts compared with UTF-16, for CJK HTML documents that inefficiency is offset by UTF-8's efficiency in encoding HTML markup. This characteristic has been key to UTF-8's dominance as a web encoding.</p> <p>B) Unlike UTF-16 (and UTF-32), UTF-8 has no big-endian and little-endian<br/>variants, and thus does not need a Byte Order Mark.</p> <p>C) UTF-8 byte sequences sort in the same order as their corresponding expanded strings sorted in Unicode code point order.</p> <p>ADMINISTRIVIA:</p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues north of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

Being a “pure” language, Haskell was initially only capable of evaluating functions without side effects, which unfortunately ruled out all forms of interacting with the operating system (file IO, user input, user output, etc.). If you’ve ever included a “print” statement in a computer program, then you may be able to imagine the scope of this limitation. In fact, programs that can’t talk to the outside world are typically not very interesting, but Haskell overcame this hurdle via Wadler’s usage of the mathematical concept of the monad, which he describes in this paper.</p> <p>After their appearance in Haskell, Monads became hugely influential in functional programming and have since made appearances in a number of languages (Scheme, Racket, F#, Scala, Ocaml, Purescript, Agda, Idris), as well as in Functional Reactive Programming frameworks such as React, Elm, and Reflex. Various other examples also leap to mind, such as C#'s LINQ (written by Erik Meijer, who served as an editor for Wadler’s “Monads” paper). Indeed, there’s now an aura and mystery around the term monad and a lot of shared humor in the world of Functional Programming about the thousands of attempts to describe this potentially befuddling concept.</p> <p>In this talk we’ll go over Wadler’s famous paper, and try to evaluate the following questions:</p> <p>Why did they create a programming language with this problem? In other words, why “purity”? How does the monad work? Why is the solution interesting beyond the world of Haskell? Our talk will attempt to follow this rubric:</p> <p>A short history of Functional Programming and Haskell A intro to Lambda Calculus and Haskell Close reading of Sections 1 through 3 of the paper Light reading of Section 5 Note: we’re planning to skip over section 4 in the talk, but it is worth reading as another extended motivating example.</p> <p>Familiarity with Haskell is unnecessary for reading and discussing the paper. However, it can potentially make two aspects of the paper easier to understand: 1) the syntax used and 2) the problems that the paper is addressing. For anyone curious about trying some Haskell in preparation for reading this paper, I recommend the following path:</p> <p>Download the stack build tool:<br/><a href=\"https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/\"><a href=\"https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/</a><br/></a>Run “stack ghci” in a terminal to start up a Haskell REPL (this will probably take awhile and require a network connection the first time…)<br/>Run through sections 2 through 6 of Learn You a Haskell for Great Good (type out all the examples in your REPL):<br/><a href=\"http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out\"><a href=\"http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out\" class=\"linkified\">http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out</a></a></p> <p>Note: I recommend avoiding the section on monads in Learn You a Haskell until after reading the Wadler paper. In fact, at this point, I’d try to avoid all discussions of monads until after reading the paper.</p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues <i>north</i> of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

Public cloud platforms now offer virtually unlimited compute and storage resources on demand. At the same time, the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model brings enterprise-class systems to users who previously could not afford such systems due to their cost and complexity. Alas, traditional data warehousing systems are struggling to fit into this new environment. For one thing, they have been designed for fixed resources and are thus unable to leverage the cloud’s elasticity. For another thing, their dependence on complex ETL pipelines and physical tuning is at odds with the flexibility and freshness requirements of the cloud’s new types of semi-structured data and rapidly evolving workloads.</p> <p>We decided a fundamental redesign was in order. Our mission was to build an enterprise-ready data warehousing solution for the cloud. The result is the Snowflake ElasticData Warehouse, or “Snowflake” for short. Snowflake is a multi-tenant, transactional, secure, highly scalable and elastic system with full SQL support and built-in extensions for semi-structured and schema-less data. The system is offered as a pay-as-you-go service in the Amazon cloud. Users up-load their data to the cloud and can immediately manage and query it using familiar tools and interfaces. Implementation began in late 2012 and Snowflake has been generally available since June 2015. Today, Snowflake is used in production by a growing number of small and large organizations alike. The system runs several million queries per day over multiple petabytes of data.</p> <p>In this paper, we describe the design of Snowflake and its novel multi-cluster, shared-data architecture. The paper highlights some of the key features of Snowflake: extreme elasticity and availability, semi-structured and schema-less data, time travel, and end-to-end security. It concludes with lessons learned and an outlook on ongoing work.</p> <p><a href=\"http://info.snowflake.net/rs/252-RFO-227/images/Snowflake_SIGMOD.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://info.snowflake.net/rs/252-RFO-227/images/Snowflake_SIGMOD.pdf</a></p> <p>Please note that the venue for this meetup has changed, to Ugather Cowork in Hillcrest.

Recent classics from this collection of techniques include skylines reimagined as though they were the subject of Starry Night, Benedict Cumberbatch seamlessly taking the place of Mona Lisa, and more recent work on stylizations that maintain structure (like a San Francisco skyline with Parisian night lighting).</p> <p>In this talk, I'll explain the basic technique, which revolves around a mathematical quantification of two distinct aspects of an image: its style and its content. Both of these are measured from feature maps in a convolutional neural network, so I'll give a light overview of these beasts, grounded in very basic image processing via filters. Are these just cute algorithms, or do they \"[offer] a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery\"?

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.</p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues north of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure.

One of the basic, apparently inherent, limitations of this technique is that an information system working with encrypted data can at most store or retrieve the data for the user; any more complicated operations seem to require that the data be decrypted before being operated on. This limitation follows from the choice of encryption functions used, however, and although there are some truly inherent limitations on what can be accomplished, we shall see that it appears likely that there exist encryption functions which permit encrypted data to be operated on without preliminary decryption of the operands, for many sets of interesting operations.

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away</p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues north of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

Bush expresses his concern for the direction of scientific efforts toward destruction, rather than understanding, and explicates a desire for a sort of collective memory machine with his concept of the memex that would make knowledge more accessible, believing that it would help fix these problems.

The implementation of such a system requires to handle lots of situations depending on the operations performed by users on files, and it is thus difficult to ensure that all the corner cases have been correctly addressed. Here, instead of verifying the implementation of such a system, we adopt a complementary approach: we introduce a theoretical model, which is defined abstractly by the universal property that it should satisfy, and work out a concrete description of it. We begin by defining a category of files and patches, where the operation of merging the effect of two coinitial patches is defined by pushout. Since two patches can be incompatible, such a pushout does not necessarily exist in the category, which raises the question of which is the correct category to represent and manipulate files in conflicting state. We provide an answer by investigating the free completion of the category of files under finite colimits, and give an explicit description of this category: its objects are finite sets labeled by lines equipped with a transitive relation and morphisms are partial functions respecting labeling and relations.</p> <p>To see some practical implications of this paper, you can take a look at a version control system based on this theory: <a href=\"https://pijul.com/model/#why-care-about-patch-theory\" class=\"linkified\">https://pijul.com/model/#why-care-about-patch-theory</a></p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues north of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

We need to understand these misconceptions more clearly in order to help students form correct conceptions. This paper describes one stage in the development of a concept inventory for Computing Fundamentals: investigation of student misconceptions in a series of core CS1 topics previously identified as both important and difficult. Formal interviews with students revealed four distinct themes, each containing many interesting misconceptions. Three of those misconceptions are detailed in this paper: two misconceptions about memory models, and data assignment when primitives are declared. Individual misconceptions are related, but vary widely, thus providing excellent material to use in the development of the CI. In addition, CS1 instructors are provided immediate usable material for helping their students understand some difficult introductory concepts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://publish.illinois.edu/glherman/files/2016/03/2010-SIGCSE-Programming-Misconceptions.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://publish.illinois.edu/glherman/files/2016/03/2010-SIGCSE-Programming-Misconceptions.pdf</a></p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues north of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius’ goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy.</p> <p>DOWNLOAD:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/differential-privacy/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/differential-privacy/</a></p> <p>INTRODUCTORY MATERIALS:</p> <p>Here's a video of Cynthia Dwork herself that serves as a great introduction to the topic of Differential Privacy:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-VhHlztqo\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-VhHlztqo</a></p> <p>This blog post also introduces the topic well:</p> <p><a href=\"https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-awesomeness.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-awesomeness.html</a></p> <p>and this follow-up goes into more detail if you want it:</p> <p><a href=\"https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-in-more-detail.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-in-more-detail.html</a></p> <p>SOME ADVICE ON READING THE PAPER:</p> <p>The paper is oddly organized.

However, there’s much more to monoids than meets the eye. Using examples taken from the diagrams vector graphics framework as a case study, I demonstrate the power and beauty of monoids for library design. The paper begins with an extremely simple model of diagrams and proceeds through a series of incremental variations, all related somehow to the central theme of monoids. Along the way, I illustrate the power of compositional semantics; why you should also pay attention to the monoid’s even humbler cousin, the semigroup; monoid homomorphisms; and monoid actions.</p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues <i>north</i> of B Street is usually easy at that hour.
