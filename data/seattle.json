The com-<br/>piler uses speculative assumptions and deoptimization in or-<br/>der to produce efficient machine code.

In this work, we empirically investigate modern ORM-backed applications’ use and disuse of database concurrency control mechanisms. Specifically, we focus our study on the common use of feral, or application-level, mechanisms for maintaining database integrity, which, across a range of ORM systems, often take the form of declarative correctness criteria, or invariants. We quantitatively analyze the use of these mechanisms in a range of open source applications written using the Ruby on Rails ORM and find that feral invariants are the most popular means of ensuring integrity (and, by usage, are over 37 times more popular than transactions). We evaluate which of these feral invariants actually ensure integrity (by usage, up to 86.9%) and which—due to concurrency errors and lack of database support—may lead to data corruption (the remainder), which we experimentally quantify. In light of these findings, we present recommendations for database system designers for better supporting these modern ORM programming patterns, thus eliminating their adverse effects on application integrity.</p> <p><b>Paper Link</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bailis.org/papers/feral-sigmod2015.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.bailis.org/papers/feral-sigmod2015.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.bailis.org/papers/feral-sigmod2015.pdf</a></a></p> <p><b>The Morning Paper Discussion</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/09/04/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity/\"><a href=\"https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/09/04/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity/\" class=\"linkified\">https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/09/04/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity/</a></a></p> <p><b>SIGMOD '15 Presentation</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/pbailis/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity\"><a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/pbailis/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity\" class=\"linkified\">https://speakerdeck.com/pbailis/feral-concurrency-control-an-empirical-investigation-of-modern-application-integrity</a></a></p> <p><b>Caitie McCaffrey's Distributed Sagas Talk</b></p> <p>This is what inspired us to discuss the paper:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UTOLRTwOX0\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UTOLRTwOX0\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UTOLRTwOX0</a></a></p> <p>I hope to see you there!</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.60566711425781,"address1":"1000 2nd Ave #1000","address2":null,"name":"Comcast Technology Solutions","postalCode":"","lon":-122.3351058959961,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1501723800000,"title":"PWL #34: Feral Concurrency Control"},"229471493":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/229471493/","description":"<p>Y'all have called my bluff, we're talking about CRDTs!

Previous approaches to eventual consistency are ad-hoc and error-prone. We study a principled approach: to base the design of shared data types on some simple formal conditions that are sufficient to guarantee eventual consistency. We call these types Convergent or Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). This paper formalises asynchronous object replication, either state based or operation based, and provides a sufficient condition appropriate for each case. It describes several useful CRDTs, including container data types supporting both add and remove operations with clean semantics, and more complex types such as graphs, montonic DAGs, and sequences. It discusses some properties needed to implement non-trivial CRDTs.</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1460683800000,"title":"PWL #18: Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types"},"rbfqfryzpbkb":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/rbfqfryzpbkb/","description":"<p>Details<br/>• What we'll do<br/>Lightning Talk: Marvin Humphrey, visiting from the San Diego chapter of Papers We Love, will present on the evolution of error handling. <a href=\"http://joeduffyblog.com/2016/02/07/the-error-model/\" class=\"linkified\">http://joeduffyblog.com/2016/02/07/the-error-model/</a></p> <p>Main Event: Alec Morgan will be presenting \"Attention Is All You Need\" (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\" class=\"linkified\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762</a>)<br/>\"The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\"<br/>(Talking to Alec last month, it's a very important modern paper for Natural Language Processing)</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>Big ups to Glympse for hosting this month!</p> <p>As a chapter of Papers We Love we abide by and enforce the PWL Code of Conduct (<a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/seattle/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/papers-we-love/seattle/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md</a>) at our events.

Scholarly attention to date has focused on their procedural due process implications. My aim here is to consider these instruments’ interaction with the enduring racial legacies of the criminal justice system There are two competing lenses for evaluating the racial effects of algorithmic criminal justice: constitutional doctrine and emerging technical standards of “algorithmic fairness.” I argue first that constitutional doctrine is poorly suited to the task. It will often fail to capture the full range of racial issues that potentially arise in the use of algorithmic tools in criminal justice. While the emerging technical standards of algorithmic fairness are at least fitted to the specifics of the relevant technology, the technical literature has failed to ask how various conceptions of fairness track (or fail to track) policy-significant consequences. Drawing on the technical literature, I propose a reformulated metric for considering racial equity considerations in algorithmic design. Rather than asking about abstract definitions of fairness, a criminal justice algorithm should be evaluated in terms of its long-term, dynamic effects on racial stratification. The metric of nondiscrimination for the algorithmic context should focus on the net burden placed on a racial minority. Surprisingly, a precise formulation of this metric suggests that it can converge with the socially efficient decision rule under certain conditions.</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>Meetup will be at this link:<br/><a href=\"https://meet.jit.si/paperswelove\" class=\"linkified\">https://meet.jit.si/paperswelove</a></p> <p>This is last minute, but it's a rough time.</p> <p>As a chapter of Papers We Love we abide by and enforce the PWL Code of Conduct (<a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/seattle/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/papers-we-love/seattle/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md</a>) at our events.

This family consists of an original (or baseline) controlled experiment and three replications. We involved 100 participants with different backgrounds and experiences in total. Overall results suggested that there is no difference in terms of effort, effectiveness, and efficiency to fix faults, when source code contains either only abbreviated or only full-word identifier names. We also conducted a qualitative study to understand the values, beliefs, and assumptions that inform and shape fault fixing when identifier names are either abbreviated or full-word. We involved in this qualitative study six professional developers with one to three years of work experience. A number of insights emerged from this qualitative study and can be considered a useful complement to the quantitative results from our family of experiments. One of the most interesting insight is that developers, when working on source code with abbreviated identifier names, adopt a more methodical approach to identify and fix faults by extending their focus point and only in a few cases they expand abbreviated identifiers.</p> <p>Mini Event: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC300808/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC300808/</a> to get some humor into our day</p> <p>Inspired by this talk:<br/><a href=\"https://www.hillelwayne.com/talks/what-we-know-we-dont-know/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.hillelwayne.com/talks/what-we-know-we-dont-know/</a></p> <p>• Important to know<br/>This meetup will be ONLINE!

Two properties of distributed systems proved difficult to model in Datalog. First, the state of any such system evolves with its execution. Second, deductions in these systems may be arbitrarily delayed, dropped, or reordered by the unreliable network links they must traverse. Previous efforts addressed the former by extending Datalog to include updates, key constraints, persistence and events, and the latter by assuming ordered and reliable delivery while ignoring delay. These details have a semantics outside Datalog, which increases the complexity of the language and its interpretation, and forces programmers to think operationally. We argue that the missing component from these previous languages is a notion of time.</p> <p>In this paper we present Dedalus, a foundation language for programming and reasoning about distributed systems. Dedalus reduces to a subset of Datalog with negation, aggregate functions, successor and choice, and adds an explicit notion of logical time to the language. We show that Dedalus provides a declarative foundation for the two signature features of distributed systems: mutable state, and asynchronous processing and communication. Given these two features, we address two important properties of programs in a domain-specific manner: a notion of safety appropriate to non-terminating computations, and stratified monotonic reasoning with negation over time. We also provide conservative syntactic checks for our temporal notions of safety and stratification. Our experience implementing full-featured systems in variants of Datalog suggests that Dedalus is well-suited to the specification of rich distributed services and protocols, and provides both cleaner semantics and richer tests of correctness.</p> <p>Tech Report version: <a href=\"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-173.html\"><a href=\"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-173.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-173.html</a></a><br/>Published version: <a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/datalog2011-dedalus.pdf\"><a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/datalog2011-dedalus.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/datalog2011-dedalus.pdf</a></a></p> <p>Earlier work:</p> <p>Overlog - <a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/netdb-09/\"><a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/netdb-09/\" class=\"linkified\">http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/netdb-09/</a></a></p> <p>Related work:<br/>Bloom - <a href=\"http://www.bloom-lang.net/\"><a href=\"http://www.bloom-lang.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.bloom-lang.net/</a></a></p> <p>The CALM and CRON Conjectures (which have since been proven): <a href=\"http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/\"><a href=\"http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/</a></a> (I recommend the keynote talk and paper, \"The Declarative Imperative\" which introduced the CALM and CRON conjectures.)</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1436491800000,"title":"PWL#9: Dedalus: Datalog in Time and Space"},"248119134":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/248119134/","description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>PWL mini:<br/>David Murray presents NL2Bash: A Corpus and Semantic Parser for Natural Language Interface to the Linux Operating System<br/>(<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08979.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08979.pdf</a>)<br/>\"We present new data and semantic parsing methods for the problem of mapping English sentences to Bash commands (NL2Bash).

However, similar abstractions do not exist for storing and accessing metadata. To fill this gap, Tango provides developers with the abstraction of a replicated, in-memory data structure (such as a map or a tree) backed by a shared log. Tango objects are easy to build and use, replicating state via simple append and read operations on the shared log instead of complex distributed protocols; in the process, they obtain properties such as linearizability, persistence and high availability from the shared log. Tango also leverages the shared log to enable fast transactions across different objects, allowing applications to partition state across machines and scale to the limits of the underlying log without sacrificing consistency.<br/>```</p> <p><b>Where is this going down?</b><br/>Thanks to Whitepages for hosting! Enter the building through the doors on 4th Ave, and head for the elevators in the southwest corner of the building.

The paper is titled: \"<b>The Dataflow Model: A Practical Approach to Balancing Correctness, Latency, and Cost in Massive-Scale, Unbounded, Out-of-Order Data Processing</b>\". This presents the state of the art in stream processing systems at scale and are also the technologies that lie at the heart of <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/what-is-google-cloud-dataflow\">Google Cloud Dataflow</a>.</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>Unbounded, unordered, global-scale datasets are increasingly common in day-to-day business (e.g. Web logs, mobile usage statistics, and sensor networks). At the same time, consumers of these datasets have evolved sophisticated requirements, such as event-time ordering and windowing by features of the data themselves, in addition to an insatiable hunger for faster answers. Meanwhile, practicality dictates that one can never fully optimize along all dimensions of correctness, latency, and cost for these types of input. As a result, data processing practitioners are left with the quandary of how to reconcile the tensions between these seemingly competing propositions, often resulting in disparate implementations and systems. We propose that a fundamental shift of approach is necessary to deal with these evolved requirements in modern data processing. We as a field must stop trying to groom unbounded datasets into finite pools of information that eventually become complete, and instead live and breathe under the assumption that we will never know if or when we have seen all of our data, only that new data will arrive, old data may be retracted, and the only way to make this problem tractable is via principled abstractions that allow the practitioner the choice of appropriate tradeoffs along the axes of interest: correctness, latency, and cost. In this paper, we present one such approach, the Dataflow Model, along with a detailed examination of the semantics it enables, an overview of the core principles that guided its design, and a validation of the model itself via the real-world experiences that led to its development.</p> <p><b>Papers:</b></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1792-Akidau.pdf\">The Dataflow Model: A Practical Approach to Balancing Correctness, Latency, and Cost in Massive-Scale, Unbounded, Out-of-Order Data Processing</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/41378.pdf\">MillWheel: Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale</a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-28800000,"time":1452825000000,"title":"PWL #15: The Dataflow Model and Millwheel: Fault tolerant stream processing"},"244676637":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/244676637/","description":"<p>PWL Mini:<br/>Ankur Chauhan presents \"LittleTable: A Time-Series Database and Its Uses\"<br/>(<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3056102\" class=\"linkified\">https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3056102</a>)</p> <p>\"We present LittleTable, a relational database that Cisco Meraki has used since 2008 to store usage statistics, event logs, and other time-series data from our customers’ devices.

We explore a large novel dataset of over 50,000 workers across 11 firms to document a variety of aspects of worker characteristics and circumstances that lead them to engage in what we call \"toxic\" behavior.<br/>We also explore the relationship between toxicity and productivity, and the ripple effect that a toxic worker has on her peers.

One of the most fundamental challenges of this paradigm is providing processing guarantees under potential failures. Existing approaches rely on periodic global state snapshots that can be used for failure recovery. Those approaches suffer from two main drawbacks. First, they often stall the overall computation which impacts ingestion. Second, they eagerly persist all records in transit along with the operation states which results in larger snapshots than required. In this work we propose Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS), a lightweight algorithm suited for modern dataflow execution engines that minimises space requirements. ABS persists only operator states on acyclic execution topologies while keeping a minimal record log on cyclic dataflows. We implemented ABS on Apache Flink, a distributed analytics engine that supports stateful stream processing. Our evaluation shows that our algorithm does not have a heavy impact on the execution, maintaining linear scalability and performing well with frequent snapshots.</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>Big ups to Comcast for hosting this month!</p> <p>As a chapter of Papers We Love we abide by and enforce the PWL Code of Conduct (<a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/seattle/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/papers-we-love/seattle/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md</a>) at our events.

These systems depend on, advocate, and generally push to the limit a fruitful idea: to present their resources as files in a hierarchical name space. The objects appearing as files may represent stored data, but may also be devices, dynamic information sources, interfaces to services, and control points. The approach unifies and provides basic naming, structuring, and access control mechanisms for all system resources. A simple underlying network protocol, Styx, forms the core of the architecture by presenting a common language for communication within the system.</i></p> <p><i>Even within non-distributed systems, the presentation of services as files advantageously extends a familiar scheme for naming, classifying, and connecting to system resources. More important, the approach provides a natural way to build distributed systems, by using well-known technology for attaching remote file systems. If resources are represented as files, and there are remote file systems, one has a distributed system: resources available in one place are usable from another.</i></p> <p>Make some noise here or in #seattle at <a href=\"https://papersweloveslack.herokuapp.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://papersweloveslack.herokuapp.com/</a>.

Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier</a>.</p> <p>\"Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust in a model. Trust is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether or not to deploy a new model. Such understanding further provides insights into the model, which can be used to turn an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction.\"</p> <p><b>Round Two</b></p> <p>Andrew Beyer presents <a href=\"http://adam.chlipala.net/papers/SqlcachePOPL17/SqlcachePOPL17.pdf\">A Program Optimization for Automatic Database Result Caching</a>.</p> <p>\"Most popular Web applications rely on persistent databases based on languages like SQL for declarative specification of data models and the operations that read and modify them. As applications scale up in user base, they often face challenges responding quickly enough to the high volume of requests. A common aid is caching of database results in the application’s memory space, taking advantage of program-specific knowledge of which caching schemes are sound and useful, embodied in handwritten modifications that make the program less maintainable. These modifications also require nontrivial reasoning about the read-write dependencies across operations. In this paper, we present a compiler optimization that automatically adds sound SQL caching to Web applications coded in the Ur/Web domain-specific functional language, with no modifications required to source code.\"</p> <p><b>Who What Where?<br/></b><br/>Big ups to <a href=\"http://thomasstreet.com/\">Thomas Street</a> for hosting!

This is a patent pending technology that analyzes voice data and predicts human emotions elicited by the paralinguistic elements of a voice.</p> <p>Human voice characteristics, such as tone, complement the verbal communication. In several contexts of communication, “how” things are said is just as important as “what” is being said. This paper provides an overview of our deployed system, the raw data, the data processing steps, and the prediction algorithms we experimented with. A case study is included where, given a voice clip, our model predicts the degree in which a listener will find the voice “engaging”. Our prediction results were verified through independent market research with 75% in agreement on how an average listener would feel. One application of Jobaline Voice Analyzer technology is for assisting companies to hire workers in the service industry where customers’ emotional response to workers’ voice may affect the service outcome. Jobaline Voice Analyzer is deployed in production as a product offer to our clients to help them identify workers who will better engage with their customers.

Before Einstein's special relativity, we had a concept called Newtonian/Galilean relativity. The idea is that if you sit in an inertial reference, like an uniformly moving train, you won't be able to tell that it is moving and the physics laws are unchanged. An outside observer to the moving train, given the train's velocity, could re-write all coordinates local to the moving train using coordinates local to the outside observer. This could be done in a simple transformation. If you transform Newton's laws of motion, you would see that they remain the same in both coordinate systems, in fact all inertial frames.<br/>The key assumption above was that time is untransformed between two observers.<br/>Maxwell's electromagnetism equations do not take the same form between two inertial frames. It also predicts electromagnetic waves moving at approximately[masked] km/h. But the question is, with respect to what?<br/>So Einstein postulates that light actually moves at this velocity with respect to all inertial observers. Which leads to the consequence that time is not going at the same rate for all observers, and actually relates to relative velocity between the two observers.<br/>This leads to a beautiful new view on the universe where space and time must be considered together as \"spacetime\".</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Big ups to Glympse for hosting this month!</p> <p>As a chapter of Papers We Love we abide by and enforce the PWL Code of Conduct (<a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/seattle/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/papers-we-love/seattle/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md</a>) at our events.

Dürst (1997).</p> <p>Presented by Marvin Humphrey.</p> <p>OVERVIEW:</p> <p>Created by Ken Thompson one night in September 1992 on a placemat in a New Jersey diner, UTF-8 is a spectacular quintuple bank shot of design: optimal across so many criteria that it's hard to believe anybody could pull it off.</p> <p>Over the years, UTF-8 has increasingly eclipsed all of the alternatives. UTF-1 and UTF-7 are obsolete and only of historical interest; UTF-32 has limited practical utility; UCS-2 can't express all of Unicode... the only serious competitor remaining is UTF-16, but UTF-8 has continued to gain market share.</p> <p>In 1997, Martin J. Dürst gave a talk at the 11th International Unicode Conference in San Jose on \"The Properties and Promises of UTF-8\". Two decades later at Papers We Love San Diego, we will review those marvelous properties and contemplate all of the promises that UTF-8 has fulfilled.</p> <p>DOWNLOAD:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sw.it.aoyama.ac.jp/2012/pub/IUC11-UTF-8.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sw.it.aoyama.ac.jp/2012/pub/IUC11-UTF-8.pdf</a></p> <p>SLIDES:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rectangular.com/preso-utf8-props-promises.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rectangular.com/preso-utf8-props-promises.pdf</a></p> <p>AUXILIARY MATERIALS:</p> <p>Here is a Rob Pike email from 2003 describing the scene in the diner, along with historical emails from Ken Thompson in 1992 articulating some of the design criteria for UTF-8:</p> <p><a href=\"http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utf-8_history\" class=\"linkified\">http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utf-8_history</a></p> <p>SOME ADVICE ON READING THE PAPER:</p> <p>Dürst's \"paper\" is really the transcription of a talk. Each page consists of a slide at the top, accompanied by text transcribing the presenter's narration over that slide. As a result, while the paper is 26 pages, it is not dense.</p> <p>A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to heuristic detection of UTF-8. We will simply accept that heuristic detection of UTF-8 works very well — so feel free to gloss over the details of the heuristic algorithm.</p> <p>If you don't have time to read the paper, contemplate the six design criteria enumerated by Ken Thompson in his 1992 email:</p> <p>1) Compatibility with historical file systems: Historical file systems disallow the null byte and the ASCII slash character as a part of the file name.</p> <p>2) Compatibility with existing programs: The existing model for multibyte processing is that ASCII does not occur anywhere in a multibyte encoding. There should be no ASCII code values for any part of a transformation format representation of a character that was not in the ASCII character set in the UCS representation of the character.</p> <p>3) Ease of conversion from/to UCS.</p> <p>4) The first byte should indicate the number of bytes to follow in a multibyte sequence.</p> <p>5) The transformation format should not be extravagant in terms of number of bytes used for encoding.</p> <p>6) It should be possible to find the start of a character efficiently starting from an arbitrary location in a byte stream.</p> <p>In addition consider the following three properties of UTF-8:</p> <p>A) Although UTF-8 is inefficient for CJK (Chinese Japanese Korean) texts compared with UTF-16, for CJK HTML documents that inefficiency is offset by UTF-8's efficiency in encoding HTML markup. This characteristic has been key to UTF-8's dominance as a web encoding.</p> <p>B) Unlike UTF-16 (and UTF-32), UTF-8 has no big-endian and little-endian<br/>variants, and thus does not need a Byte Order Mark.</p> <p>C) UTF-8 byte sequences sort in the same order as their corresponding expanded strings sorted in Unicode code point order.</p> <p>Big ups to Comcast for hosting this month!</p> <p>As a chapter of Papers We Love we abide by and enforce the PWL Code of Conduct (<a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/seattle/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/papers-we-love/seattle/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md</a>) at our events.

The Amazon.com platform, which provides services for many web sites worldwide, is implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands of servers and network components located in many datacenters around the world. At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon’s core services use to provide an “always-on” experience. To achieve this level of availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios. It makes extensive use of object versioning and application-assisted conflict resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface for developers to use.  </p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~agrawal/fall2009/dynamo.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~agrawal/fall2009/dynamo.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~agrawal/fall2009/dynamo.pdf</a></a><br/></b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>NOTE: We are still looking for a venue for this event.

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure:<br/>each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.<br/>The TL;DR is data should be organized in a way such that every row corresponds to an observation and every column corresponds to a variable.</p> <p>Main Event:<br/>Mohannad Elhamod presents Efficient Determination of Dynamic Split Points in a Decision Tree<br/>(<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/splits.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/splits.pdf</a>)<br/>\"We consider the problem of choosing split points for continuous predictor variables in a decision tree.

In this paper, we describe a number<br/>of alternative approaches that generate a small number<br/>of candidate split points dynamically with little overhead.<br/>We argue that these approaches are preferable to<br/>pre-discretization, and provide experimental evidence that<br/>they yield probabilistic decision trees with the same prediction<br/>accuracy as the traditional dynamic approach. Furthermore,<br/>because the time to grow a decision tree is proportional<br/>to the number of split points evaluated, our approach<br/>is significantly faster than the traditional dynamic<br/>approach.\"</p> <p>Dinner will be provided!

Sharing improves cluster utilization and avoids per-framework data replication. Mesos shares resources in a fine-grained manner, allowing frameworks to achieve data locality by taking turns reading data stored on each machine. To support the sophisticated schedulers of today's frameworks, Mesos introduces a distributed two-level scheduling mechanism called resource offers. Mesos decides how many resources to offer each framework, while frameworks decide which resources to accept and which computations to run on them. Our results show that Mesos can achieve near-optimal data locality when sharing the cluster among diverse frameworks, can scale to 50,000 (emulated) nodes, and is resilient to failures.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Presenter:</b></p> <p>Ankur Chauhan</p> <p><b>Links:</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf\"><a href=\"https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mesos.apache.org\"><a href=\"http://mesos.apache.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://mesos.apache.org</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/mesos-frameworks/\">List of Mesos Frameworks</a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1439517600000,"title":"Mesos - A Platform for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center"},"228753723":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/228753723/","description":"<p>Fuzzing is a technique to find software defects by providing random(ish) input to a system, and watching to see which patterns of input cause bad behavior.</p> <p>The paper is \"Fuzzing: The State of the Art\", available here: <br/><a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a558209.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a558209.pdf</a></p> <p>The talk will go over the history of fuzzing, different methods of fuzzing, and how fuzzing can be applicable to your everyday life.</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-28800000,"time":1457663400000,"title":"PWL #17: Fuzzing: The State of the Art"},"226493450":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/226493450/","description":"<p>Trevor Lalish-Menagh will present \"A Critique of the CAP Theorem.\" Abstract:</p> <p>The CAP Theorem is a frequently cited impossibility result in distributed systems, especially among NoSQL distributed databases. In this paper we survey some of the confusion about the meaning of CAP, including inconsistencies and ambiguities in its definitions, and we highlight some problems in its formalization. CAP is often interpreted as proof that eventually consistent databases have better availability properties than strongly consistent databases; although there is some truth in this, we show that more careful reasoning is required. These problems cast doubt on the utility of CAP as a tool for reasoning about trade-offs in practical systems. As alternative to CAP, we propose a \"delay-sensitivity\" framework, which analyzes the sensitivity of operation latency to network delay, and which may help practitioners reason about the trade-offs between consistency guarantees and tolerance of network faults.</p> <p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05393\" class=\"linkified\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05393</a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-28800000,"time":1449801000000,"title":"PWL #14: A Critique of the CAP Theorem"},"227211670":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/227211670/","description":"<p>Tristan Penman will present Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications.</p> <p>\"A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and ex- periments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.\"</p> <p><a href=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf\"><a href=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf</a></a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-28800000,"time":1455244200000,"title":"PWL #16: Chord"},"209319592":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/209319592/","description":"<p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>Immutable vectors are a convenient data structure for functional programming and part of the standard library of modern languages like Clojure and Scala.

However, building such a prediction system is challenging on two fronts. First, the relationships between video quality and observed session features can be quite complex. Second, video quality changes dynamically. Thus, we need a prediction model that is (a) expressive enough to capture these complex relationships and (b) capable of updating quality predictions in near real-time. Unfortunately, several seemingly natural solutions (e.g., simple machine learning approaches and simple network models) fail on one or more fronts. Thus, the potential benefits promised by these prior efforts remain unrealized. We address these challenges and present the design and implementation of Critical Feature Analytics (CFA). The design of CFA is driven by domain-specific insights that video quality is typically determined by a small subset of critical features whose criticality persists over several tens of minutes. This enables a scalable and accurate workflow where we automatically learn critical features for different sessions on coarse-grained timescales, while updating quality predictions in near real-time. Using a combination of a real-world pilot deployment and trace-driven analysis, we demonstrate that CFA leads to significant improvements in video quality; e.g., 32% less buffering time and 12% higher bitrate than a random decision maker.</p> <p>Paper: <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-jiang-junchen.pdf\"><a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-jiang-junchen.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-jiang-junchen.pdf</a></a></p> <p>Presenter: Ankur Chauhan (Sr Software Engineer, Brightcove Inc.)</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.609004974365234,"address1":"1301 5th Avenue #1600","address2":null,"name":"Whitepages","postalCode":"98101","lon":-122.33439636230469,"country":"us","city":"Seattle"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1463103000000,"title":"PWL #19: CFA: A Practical Prediction System for Video QoE Optimization"},"sdftxpyzcbfb":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/sdftxpyzcbfb/","description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>PWL mini:<br/>Maie - A Unified approach to interpreting model predictions<br/>(<a href=\"http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions\" class=\"linkified\">http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions</a>)</p> <p>Main Event:<br/>Eric Wolak - Kademlia - A peer to peer Information system based on XOR Metric<br/>(<a href=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf</a>)</p> <p>Dinner will be provided!
