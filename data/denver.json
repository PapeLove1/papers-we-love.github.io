Other subjects, especially those under the umbrella of liberal arts, are often thought of as less important, or just an annoying requirement to graduate. However, much of what helps you become a great software engineer, and create outstanding software that people want to use, comes from outside the world of STEM. This might sound like great advice to give to a freshman computer science student, but it's equally helpful for the 20-year software veteran.</p> <p>Computer science is the study of algorithms, data structures, and operating systems. Programming is the practical implementation of computer science. Software engineering is the use of software to solve problems. The ability to effectively analyze a problem, evaluate different options, and engineer a solution requires the skills taught in the liberal arts.</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":39.76769256591797,"address1":"3412 Blake St","address2":null,"name":"Code Talent","postalCode":"","lon":-104.97679138183594,"country":"us","city":"Denver"},"utcOffset":-21600000,"time":1555462800000,"title":"A Great Engineer Needs the Liberal Arts"},"fgbdrmyxpbdc":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Denver/events/fgbdrmyxpbdc/","description":false,"photos":[],"venue":{"lat":39.76769256591797,"address1":"3412 Blake St","address2":null,"name":"Code Talent","postalCode":"","lon":-104.97679138183594,"country":"us","city":"Denver"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1542938400000,"title":"TBD, but probably an awesome paper :-)"},"fgbdrmyxnbhc":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Denver/events/fgbdrmyxnbhc/","description":false,"photos":[],"venue":{"lat":39.76769256591797,"address1":"3412 Blake St","address2":null,"name":"Code Talent","postalCode":"","lon":-104.97679138183594,"country":"us","city":"Denver"},"utcOffset":-21600000,"time":1540515600000,"title":"TBD, but probably an awesome paper :-)"},"fgbdrmywgbkc":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Denver/events/fgbdrmywgbkc/","description":"<p>Come see Aysylu Greenberg (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aysylu22\">@aysylu22</a>) talk about one of her favorite papers:</p> <p><a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~cidon/materials/CR.pdf\">Copysets: Reducing the Frequency of Data Loss in Cloud Storage</a></p> <p>It describes an interesting approach to data replication which allows for finer control over the probability of data loss occurrence and the amount of data loss during such an event.
