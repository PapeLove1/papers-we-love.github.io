As always, reading in advance is encouraged but not required. We would love to talk with you!</p> <p>Roy Fielding's PhD thesis ( <a href=\"https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm</a> ) , published in the year 2000, was intended to describe and improve the architecture of the then-nascent and burgeoning World Wide Web. Today it's almost equally known (if not always _read_) for Fielding's coinage of the moniker Representational State Transfer (REST). In some ways, this makes its impact doubly significant: It was the best description of the architecture of the web when published, and it is still influencing the evolution of the web today.</p> <p>Today, it's common to (perhaps incorrectly) use the term \"REST\" to describe something decidedly unlike what Fielding describes in his dissertation, such as OpenAPI. While acknowledging that there is no single architectural style which is appropriate for every purpose, it is worthwhile to understand accurately what Fielding described, a year before the \"invention\" of JSON.</p> <p>This is the first time Papers We Love Columbus has read a college thesis. If it's your first time as well, I recommend you start with this _very, very short_ guide to what a PhD is. <a href=\"http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/\" class=\"linkified\">http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/</a></p> <p>Fielding's thesis is divided into 6 chapters. The introduction plus the first three essentially set the stage for the major contributions to follow. One useful way to think about the structure of the thesis in hindsight is to consider it in reverse: Chapters 5-6 describe REST and how to evaluate it in light of the methodology described in the preceding chapters. Chapter 3 describes different sorts of architectural styles for network-based applications, with a particular interest in hypermedia systems such as the world wide web. Chapters 1-2 discuss how to evaluate such systems.</p> <p>So, how should we go about reading this? Chapters 1-3 are, in a sense, preliminary material. There are contributions to the field here, but they are largely in service to the chapters which follow. So I propose we start by reading the introduction through chapter 3. That's a fairly large page count -- although the pages are double-spaced! It's fine to skim over certain sections, particularly \"Related Work,\" which were of no doubt interesting to Fielding's thesis committee, but might be less important to readers today. If you don't make it through chapter 3 by our meetup, no worries! We can either talk about the material in person or extend the initial reading time.</p> <p>What I think we really want to accomplish in our first meeting is to set the stage for chapters 4-6, which in my mind are the most significant contributions of the dissertation and which we'll cover in our next meeting.</p> <p>If you have any questions while you are approaching this material, please reach out in the discussion forums on Meetup or on Twitter ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PapersWeLoveCMH\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/PapersWeLoveCMH</a> ) and I can try to help out!</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":39.96528625488281,"address1":"141 N High St.","address2":null,"name":"Deli Boys","postalCode":"","lon":-83.00164794921875,"country":"us","city":"Columbus"},"utcOffset":-18000000,"time":1541694600000,"title":"What is REST, really? \"The Design of Network-based Software Architectures\""},"254980575":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/254980575/","description":"<p>Our current book is \"A Philosophy of Software Design,\" by Stanford professor John Ousterhout.

As always, reading in advance is encouraged but not required. We would love to talk with you!</p> <p>This will be our last meeting of 2018! Our next meeting will likely be 17 January 2019. Happy holidays/CodeMash, everyone!</p> <p>Roy Fielding's PhD thesis ( <a href=\"https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm</a> ), published in the year 2000, was intended to describe and improve the architecture of the then-nascent and burgeoning World Wide Web. Today it's almost equally known (if not always _read_) for Fielding's coinage of the moniker Representational State Transfer (REST). In some ways, this makes its impact doubly significant: It was the best description of the architecture of the web when published, and it is still influencing the evolution of the web today.</p> <p>Today, it's common to (perhaps incorrectly) use the term \"REST\" to describe something decidedly unlike what Fielding describes in his dissertation, such as OpenAPI. While acknowledging that there is no single architectural style which is appropriate for every purpose, it is worthwhile to understand accurately what Fielding described, a year before the \"invention\" of JSON.</p> <p>This is the first time Papers We Love Columbus has read a college thesis. If it's your first time as well, I recommend you start with this _very, very short_ guide to what a PhD is. <a href=\"http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/\" class=\"linkified\">http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/</a></p> <p>Fielding's thesis is divided into 6 chapters. The introduction plus the first three essentially set the stage for the major contributions to follow. One useful way to think about the structure of the thesis in hindsight is to consider it in reverse: Chapters 5-6 describe REST and how to evaluate it in light of the methodology described in the preceding chapters. Chapter 3 describes different sorts of architectural styles for network-based applications, with a particular interest in hypermedia systems such as the world wide web. Chapters 1-2 discuss how to evaluate such systems.</p> <p>If you have any questions while you are approaching this material, please reach out in the discussion forums on Meetup or on Twitter ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PapersWeLoveCMH\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/PapersWeLoveCMH</a> ) and I can try to help out!</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":39.96528625488281,"address1":"141 N High St.","address2":null,"name":"Deli Boys","postalCode":"","lon":-83.00164794921875,"country":"us","city":"Columbus"},"utcOffset":-18000000,"time":1544113800000,"title":"What is REST, really? \"The Design of Network-based Software Architectures\""},"246956913":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/246956913/","description":"<p>We're going to discuss chapter 4 (gdb), chapter 5 (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and chapter 19 (PyPy).

Although prior research has shown that APIs commonly suffer from significant usability problems, little attention has been given to studying how APIs are designed and created in the first place. We interviewed 24 professionals involved with API design from 7 major companies to identify their training and design processes. Interviewees had insights into many different aspects of designing for API usability and areas of significant struggle. For example, they learned to do API design on the job, and had little training for it in school. During the design phase they found it challenging to discern which potential use cases of the API users will value most. After an API is released, designers lack tools to gather aggregate feedback from this data even as developers openly discuss the API online.</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":39.96528625488281,"address1":"141 N High St.","address2":null,"name":"Deli Boys","postalCode":"","lon":-83.00164794921875,"country":"us","city":"Columbus"},"utcOffset":-14400000,"time":1539271800000,"title":"API Designers in the Field: Design Practices and Challenges"},"jsfhrmywgbqb":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/jsfhrmywgbqb/","description":"<p>The book club is currently reading  <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms\">Grokking Algorithms</a>, by Aditya Y.

The results would be delivered to the customer, encrypted with a key that only they knew. It sounds like an ideal solution, but maybe impossible?</p> <p>This is the promise of homomorphic encryption.

Herbsleb.</p> <p>The paper uses empirical review of two large scale software projects to analyze a proposition that changing the way that teams are organized can have a positive effect on overall project productivity by reducing friction due to dependencies, and finds evidence in the affirmative.</p> <p>Here's part of the abstract.</p> <p>\"The success of software development projects depends on carefully and effectively coordinating the effort of many individuals across the multiple stages of the development process. In software engineering, modularization is the traditional technique intended to reduce the interdependencies among modules that constitute a system. Reducing technical dependencies, the theory argues, results in a reduction of work dependencies between teams developing interdependent modules. Organizational researchers have proposed similar theoretical arguments. Although such research streams have been quite influential, they have taken a coarse-grain and static view of the problem of coordination in engineering activities. This paper proposes a new perspective on coordination where fine-grain and evolving dependencies are front and central.\"</p> <p>The paper is on the longish side at 40 pages. Don't feel obligated to read the entire thing if it's more than you want to take on. We'll talk about the entire paper, but if you don't care to read all 40 pages I'd recommend reading the first few sections, which introduce the theory and the experimental methodology, and section X (the last few pages), which summarizes their results.
