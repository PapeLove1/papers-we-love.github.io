You do P2P! I created a distributed smart office using Elixir that runs in a single P2P network. There are a lot of subtleties into this. How can we prevent someone from entering the network? How do we manage shared data? What topology do we use? How about nodes that are unrealiable and we are not sure when they will connect or disconnect? What if YOU want to add a node and we can't trust you to deliver messages? I will use the office as an example and teach you how different the reasoning between a web-like centralised context and a P2P distributed system is. We will go from simple P2P topologies (gossip, trees) to more complex ones (Gnutella2, HyParView, Plumtrees), analyse their problems and take a look at what CRDTs are and how awesome they can be for shared data.</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Mendes exchanges coffee for code.

Edge bundling is based on visually clustering edges and, at that time, the main focus was on bundling together edges based on their spatial proximity. After reading several papers on the subject, \"Graph Bundling by Kernel Density Estimation‚Äù (<a href=\"http://www.cs.rug.nl/~alext/PAPERS/EuroVis12/kdeeb.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cs.rug.nl/~alext/PAPERS/EuroVis12/kdeeb.pdf</a>) was the one that inspired me the most due to its simplicity and potential to handle large graphs.</p> <p>In this sessions of paper we love, I will explain you the rationale of graph bundling based on kernel density estimation, propose simplifications that make the algorithm more efficient and easier to implement, and show how the base algorithm can be extend to handle different clustering criteria and to produce videos of evolving graphs. Finally, I will present visualisations that try to illustrate the potential of edge bundling (teaser: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/visualising-flow-bus-passengers-porto-new-algorithm-daniel-moura/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/visualising-flow-bus-passengers-porto-new-algorithm-daniel-moura/</a>).</p> <p>You can read the paper here: <a href=\"http://www.cs.rug.nl/~alext/PAPERS/EuroVis12/kdeeb.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cs.rug.nl/~alext/PAPERS/EuroVis12/kdeeb.pdf</a></p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Daniel Moura joined Veniam on September 2015 and is the Head of Data, leading Data Science and Business Intelligence. PhD in Informatics by University of Porto (2011), Daniel has 11 years of experience in data analysis, 17 years in computer science and engineering, 7 years as teaching assistant on computer science subjects, 9 publications in peer-reviewed journals, 3 international patents, and several papers in international conferences.

Before joining Veniam, Daniel was Research Associate at University of Porto, where he was responsible for data analysis in the FP7 Future Cities project.</p> <p>Talk 2: Ethereum: A secure decentralised generalised transaction ledger by Hugo Peixoto</p> <p>The blockchain paradigm when coupled with cryptographically-secured transactions has demonstrated its utility through a number of projects, not least Bitcoin. Each such project can be seen as a simple application on a decentralised, but singleton, compute resource. We can call this paradigm a transactional singleton machine with shared-state.</p> <p>Ethereum implements this paradigm in a generalised manner. Furthermore it provides a plurality of such resources, each with a distinct state and operating code but able to interact through a message-passing framework with others. We discuss its design, implementation issues, the opportunities it provides and the future hurdles we envisage.</p> <p>You can read the paper here: <a href=\"https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf</a></p> <p>Hope to see you soon!</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":41.151947021484375,"address1":"Rua do Alferes Malheiro 97 4th floor","address2":null,"name":"Veniam (conference room)","postalCode":null,"lon":-8.610437393188477,"country":"pt","city":"Porto"},"utcOffset":3600000,"time":1528912800000,"title":"PWL #05 :: Edge Bundling and Ethereum"},"255632610":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Porto/events/255632610/","description":"<p>Hello everyone üëã</p> <p>We're getting ready for the 7th session of Papers We Love @ Porto.</p> <p>Let's sit together and discuss about one of the most misunderstood concept in distributed systems, introduced by Eric A.

These Web Applications (WAs) represent thousands of type of services we can interact with like weather forecast and Application Programming Interface (API) which use by themselves other WAs. API provides at a certain authorization level access to multi-source data using several request endpoints in a multi-tier architecture where performance is critical and it must be ensured the best throughput, response time and availability. This study presents the implementation of three open-source web frameworks (Revel, Gin and Echo) in a corporate API developed by Movvo¬Æ in order to evaluate the overall architecture using Apache Benchmark as a load testing tool. Results show Gin contributed to the fastest response times for a set of requests that vary on processing and retrieved data complexity.</p> <p>&amp;gt; Causality is simple</p> <p>Causality is an essential component of how we make sense of the physical world, and of our relations to other humans. If I put a cup on the table, and look back at it, I expect it to be there. I also expect to get a reply to my postcards, after I send them, and not before. These days hardly any service can claim not to have some form of distributed algorithm at its core. In a distributed scenario, if we are not careful, it is very easy to break the causal sense of things. In a key-value store my writes can be directed to a replica, and my subsequent reads served from an outdated one --- my cup might not be there when I look back. Message dissemination middleware might not always provide the ordering I expect --- I might receive some replies, before their leading questions.</p> <p>Luckily, most of these problems were already there 30 years ago, although in a much smaller scale, and lots of techniques have been developed to keep track of causality and make sense of the complex interactions in modern systems. However developers often look at techniques such as as replica synchronization with version vectors, or causal broadcasting algorithms, as black boxes; or as complex sets of rules that have to be followed and not questioned.</p> <p>This talk will focus on bringing back the intuition on causality, and show that keeping in mind some simple concepts, allows to understand how version vectors and vector clocks work, and were they differ, and how to use more sophisticated mechanisms to handle millions of concurrent clients in modern distributed data stores.</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Carlos Baquero is an Assistant Professor and teaches Distributed Systems at Universidade do Minho, Portugal. He is a Senior Researcher at the High Assurance Laboratory within INESC TEC. In the 90s, motivated by mobile computing and disconnected operation for file systems, he studied data types with merge (and fork) operations over semi-lattices, a precursor to state-based CRDTs. He is also interested in causality and in distributed aggregation algorithms. He specially likes all things distributed that eventually merge.</p> <p>Details</p> <p>Doors will open around 18:30 and presentations will start after a quick introduction of the meetup, around 19:00.</p> <p>After each presentation, we will open up the floor for discussion, questions and drinks!</p> <p>This meetup will be sponsored by XING.</p> <p>Hope to see you soon!</p> <p>--</p> <p>If you want to present a paper either in a full or lightning-talk format, feel free to reach @ordepdev or submit the CFP form (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OfwO8XlESmka1uWB_HczuCjsy__o8ORdqEEKBmGXQxA\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OfwO8XlESmka1uWB_HczuCjsy__o8ORdqEEKBmGXQxA</a>).</p> ","photos":[{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/5/5/600_469487701.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/5/6/600_469487702.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/5/7/600_469487703.jpeg","height":null,"width":null}],"venue":{"lat":41.17802429199219,"address1":"461 Rua Alfredo Allen","address2":null,"name":"UPTEC - Polo Tecnol√≥gico","postalCode":null,"lon":-8.605775833129883,"country":"pt","city":"Porto"},"utcOffset":0,"time":1521745200000,"title":"March :: Papers We Love #02"},"cmmfnqyzcbtb":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Porto/events/cmmfnqyzcbtb/","description":"<p>Hello everyone üëã</p> <p>We're getting ready for the 8th session of Papers We Love @ Porto.

It sits on top of a framework of abstractions which enable programmers to more easily reason about concurrency and distribution, and to better utilize the current trend of multi-core processors.</p> <p>Due to its underlying model a large set of common problems (e.g., deadlocks, race conditions) found in these type of systems are eliminated or harder to incur into. Nonetheless, certain Erlang programs can be affected by this class of errors.</p> <p>Concuerror is a stateless model checking tool for debugging, testing and verifying Erlang programs. Its aim is to detect and debug concurrency errors via interleaving techniques for Erlang's process-oriented systems. In this talk we will get an overview of how this tool works, details about its implementation and a demo where we will see how it can be used to improve Erlang programs.</p> <p>üìú The consensus is that we won't come to a consensus about consensus protocols.</p> <p>Distributed systems are fun.</p> <p>We want them to linearizable, we want them to be high performant, we want them to be highly available ... as soon as the daemons start!<br/>Isn't it what is supposed to do?</p> <p>In fact, distributed system have a lot of design features that turn them into beasts we barely know but keep on using, and consensus protocols aren't the exception here.</p> <p>From Raft to the many flavors of Paxos to some others that came after we will take a close look and understand what they are doing.</p> <p>Let's find out if in fact we should trust the consensus features in Cassandra, Etcd, Consul, TiKV, Kudu, CockroachDB, RethinkDB, ScyllaDB, Google Spanner, Neo4j or Ceph.</p> <p>If you like distributed systems and papers which flame one another this is your talk!</p> <p>Details</p> <p>Doors will open around 18:30 and we'll start the talk after a quick introduction of the meetup, around 19:00. After networking, we can grab dinner nearby!</p> <p>Hope to see you soon üéâ</p> ","photos":[{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/7/7/600_479854679.jpeg","height":null,"width":null}],"venue":{"lat":41.149078369140625,"address1":"Av. de Camilo 94","address2":null,"name":"Blip","postalCode":null,"lon":-8.594792366027832,"country":"pt","city":"Porto"},"utcOffset":0,"time":1553626800000,"title":"PWL #10 :: Concurrency & Consensus"},"252595151":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Porto/events/252595151/","description":"<p>Hello everyone, we have great news for you!</p> <p>Our sixth session will be hosted by Blip (<a href=\"https://blip.pt\" class=\"linkified\">https://blip.pt</a>) and we'll have two amazing talks for you. We're super happy to have both JoƒÅo Fernandes (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2m9ocSe\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2m9ocSe</a>), and Miguel Palhas (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/naps62\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/naps62</a>) talking about two great scientific topics!</p> <p>Talk 1: Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search by JoƒÅo Fernandes</p> <p>The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. JoƒÅo will introduce to us this new approach to computer Go that uses value networks to evaluate board positions and policy networks to select moves.</p> <p>Talk 2: Distributed Consensus by Miguel Palhas</p> <p>Miguel will give us an overview of some distributed consensus algorithms, from the original Hashcash/Bitcoin to some exciting research that tries to solve the know problems from the original solutions.</p> <p>Details</p> <p>Doors will open around 18:30 and presentations will start after a quick introduction of the meetup, around 19:00.</p> <p>After each presentation, we will open up the floor for discussion, questions and drinks!</p> <p>Hope to see you soon üéâ</p> ","photos":[{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/a/0/3/600_473211715.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/a/0/4/600_473211716.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/a/0/8/600_473211720.jpeg","height":null,"width":null}],"venue":{"lat":41.149078369140625,"address1":"Av. de Camilo 94","address2":null,"name":"Blip","postalCode":null,"lon":-8.594792366027832,"country":"pt","city":"Porto"},"utcOffset":3600000,"time":1532455200000,"title":"PWL #06 :: Deep Neural Networks and Distributed Consensus"}}
