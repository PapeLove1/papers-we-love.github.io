But Prolog's Horn Clauses are fairly simplistic in terms of what they can express. This paper talks about a few relatively simple techniques that lets us extend to a much richer logic, supporting things like proving that one statement implies another, or proving \"for all\" predicates. So for example where Prolog could perhaps setup rules to decide when `hungry(joe)` is true or `hungry(nancy)`, this technique describes techniques to prove `hungry(P)` is true for *any* person P.</p> <p>\"A proof procedure for the logic of hereditary Harrop formulas\", Gopalan Nadathur, Journal of Automated Reasoning, Feb 1993, 11(1), pp[masked].</p> <p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00881902\" class=\"linkified\">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00881902</a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":42.36275863647461,"address1":"355 Main Street, ","address2":null,"name":"Google - Cambridge Office ","postalCode":"","lon":-71.08711242675781,"country":"us","city":"cambridge "},"utcOffset":-14400000,"time":1526594400000,"title":"Niko Matsakis on Lambda Prolog"},"229581624":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/events/229581624/","description":"<p><b>PWL Boston / Cambridge </b></p> <p>We are thrilled to have Peter Bailis as the speaker for our April meeting.  Peter is brilliant researcher and outstanding speaker.  He will be presenting on <a href=\"http://www.vldb.org/conf/2002/S07P01.pdf\">Streaming Queries over Streaming Data\" from VLDB 2002</a> by Sirish Chandrasekaran and Michael J.
