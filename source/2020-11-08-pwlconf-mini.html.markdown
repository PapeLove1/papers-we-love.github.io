### November 18, 2020 - 17:45 EST on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/paperswelove)

<a href="https://connect.clickandpledge.com/w/Form/a9f96acc-aa05-4c52-a9b4-e12ab505abdf"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/all/themes/custom/cotija/images/logo.svg" style="padding: 20px; float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0" /></a>Like many non-profit organizations (ourselves included) [USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/) has struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conferences made up a large part of their revenue streams, and their cancellation has deprived USENIX of operating funds. As a [major source of research papers](https://www.usenix.org/publications) in Computer Science and Networking we'd like to help anyway we can. **So we're going to try something new to help raise donations for USENIX: a streaming mini-conference.**

We want to do something in the evening, so this will be a small event. We'll start with a panel led by **[Adrian Colyer](https://blog.acolyer.org/)**, which will include guests **[Justine Sherry](https://www.justinesherry.com/)**, **[Dan R. K. Ports](https://drkp.net/)**, **[Ada Gavrilovska](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/ada/)**, and one or two more people who are TBD. Then, we'll have **[Jeff Dean](https://research.google/people/jeff/)** and **[Irene Zhang](https://irenezhang.net/)** presenting on papers related to their research.

We're still working out the format of the panel, but we're currently thinking of a topic along the lines of "the future of systems research".

We'll [stream live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/paperswelove) on November 18 at 17:45 EST. Aftwerwards we'll post the video to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PapersWeLove) once we've done some editing.

**This is a fund raiser** so we're asking everyone who attends to [make a donation to USENIX](https://connect.clickandpledge.com/w/Form/a9f96acc-aa05-4c52-a9b4-e12ab505abdf). Almost every local chapter of Papers We Love has presented a paper from USENIX over the years, so this is our chance to give back.
