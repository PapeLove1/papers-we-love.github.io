# PWLGT - Papers we Love Guatemala City 

This is the repository for the Guatemala City chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/guatemala-city/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Information

This meetup is a regional chapter of [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org). The general format is that once a month one member will present one computer science paper using e.g. speech, slides, demonstration. Attendees are encouraged, but not required, to read and digest the paper in advance of the meeting.

What was the last paper you read and loved within the realm of computing? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come and share the ideas of an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, scientists, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown on the paper. It is also okay to just come, listen, and discuss!

### Who are we?

We are developers, engineers, academics, and other tech professionals who live in Guatemala city. Whether you're a new computer science student or a seasoned developer or scientist, we welcome you to join usâ€“the only requirements are respect and an eagerness to learn!

### How?

Reading a paper is not the same as reading a novel or a blogpost. These are few resources to help you get started.
