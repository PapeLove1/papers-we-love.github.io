Do you want to meet awesome people? We are the first community of PWL in Mexico and we are trying to grow the interest for reading and discussing papers in the country by connecting people from universities, researcher centers and industry. Come to share your ideas with awesome people, or just come to listen and discuss! (and maybe eat some tacos in the process ðŸŒ®)
