# Kansas City, MO

Papers We Love Kansas City (PWL KC) is a community built around reading,
discussing and learning more about academic computer science papers and related
topics.

Whether it's theory, applications in real world software engineering, or live
programming with a novel project, PWL KC is a group for people who are
interested in learning more about papers related to the topic of
computation. No formal background in computer science or software engineering
is required, merely an interest in the topics and a passion to learn.

Once a month, a member of the group will have prepared a ~15-45 minute
presentation on a paper they read to the rest of the group. The format and
nature of the presentation is largely up to the presenter: live programming,
interactive power points, or simple slide show are all valid, non-exhaustive,
formats. After the presentation, 5-15 minutes is typically set aside for
further discussion and group Q/A with that meeting's presenter.
