# Buenos Aires 

What was the last paper you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come and share the ideas of an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, scientists, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown on the paper. It is also okay to just come, listen, and discuss!
