## Madrid - April 6, 2016

* **Meetup:** [http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Madrid/events/229616859/](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Madrid/events/229616859/)

### Félix López on Epidemic Broadcast Trees

While I was working on the presentation for Plumtree I realized that the gossip introduction is itself quite long, so I'm going to split the talk in two. In this first one I will introduce Gossip protocols and I will go over these papers:

* [A. Demers, D. Greene, C. Hauser, W. Irish, J. Larson, S. Shenker, H. Sturgis, D. Swinehart, and D. Terry. “Epidemic Algorithms for Replicated Database Maintenance.” In Proc. Sixth Symp. on Principles of Distributed Computing, pp. 1–12, Aug. 1987.](http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/CSL-89-1_Epidemic_Algorithms_for_Replicated_Database_Maintenance.pdf)
* [Ken Birman. The Promise, and Limitations, of Gossip Protocols. ACM SIGOPS Oper. Syst. Rev., 41(5):8–13, October 2007](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1317382)

We will talk about the paper "Epidemic Broadcast Trees" by J. Leitão, J. Pereira, and L. Rodrigues.

This paper proposes an integrated broadcast scheme that combines both Gossip protocols and deterministic tree-based protocols. The paper proposes a new protocol "Plumtree", a derivative of which is now used by Riak for gossiping bucket properties.
