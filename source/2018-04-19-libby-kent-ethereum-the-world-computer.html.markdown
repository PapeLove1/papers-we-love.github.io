**Description**

In 2009 bitcoin emerged as a peer-to-peer value transfer system, and was successfully deployed throughout the world. Four years later (2013), the Ethereum white paper was published by an 18 year old Vitalik Buterin which builds on top of the Bitcoin consensus model to allow for distributed computation and applications to be deployed on a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

This paper discusses introducing a turing complete language that can be run on top of the network, utilizing a modified consensus algorithm (GHOST), strategies for defending against mining centralization, further application of such a system beyond just finance, the introduction of state, as well as a history of bitcoin and and the fundamental concepts of the underlying blockchain.
