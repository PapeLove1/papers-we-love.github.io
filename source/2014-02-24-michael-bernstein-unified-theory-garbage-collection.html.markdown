This our inaugural Meetup, and we're excited to have [Michael Bernstein](http://michaelrbernste.in/) presenting the paper [A Uniﬁed Theory of Garbage Collection](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs415/reading/bacon-garbage.pdf) by David F. Bacon, Perry Cheng, and V.T. Rajan. READMORE

## Bio

Mike Bernstein is obsessed. Not with anything in particular, just in general. He's a Brooklyn, NYC based software developer and amateur Computer Scientist who writes at [http://michaelrbernste.in](http://michaelrbernste.in/) and tweets (too much) at [@mrb_bk](https://twitter.com/mrb_bk). He's given talks on Garbage Collection and Distributed Systems in the past and is very excited to hang and chat with fellow NYC obsessives.

## Details

Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be beer and pizza.

After Michael presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.

We hope that you'll read the paper before the Meetup (and if you don't, no worries, be happy now!), and if you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *github-thread* on the matter: [https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/1](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/1).

Additionally, if you have any papers you want to add to the repository above, please send us a pull request.
